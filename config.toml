# mariner configuration file
# =============================================================================
# This file holds the configuration of mariner. It can be placed on either of
# the following paths:
#   * ./config.toml (the running directory)
#   * ~/.mariner/config.toml (home directory)
#   * /etc/mariner/config.toml
#
# The config is formatted in the TOML format, see https://toml.io/en/ for
# details on how TOML formats work.

# The directory to which files should be uploaded. This is usually the same
# directory that you are sharing to the printer through the USB Gadget
files_directory = "/mnt/usb_share"

[file_list]
# The sort order for the file list in the frontend. Can be:
#   * "alpha" - for Alphanumeric sort
#   * "creation" - for creation date/time sort
#sort_order = "creation"

# Show or hide files.  
# Must be "true" or "false" 
#show_hidden = "true"

[printer]
# The name which will be displayed for the printer in the UI. By default no
# printer name is displayed. Uncomment this line and set it to whatever you
# want if you want to show a name on the print status. Useful for people with
# multiple printers running multiple instances of mariner.
#display_name = "Elegoo Mars Pro"

# Serial port settings. Most of the time the default values are fine. This
# is generally only helpful if you aren't running mariner on a Raspberry Pi
# or if you are running with a printer that uses a different baud rate.
serial_port = "/dev/serial0"
baudrate = 115200

[http]
# Hostname or IP address (string) on which to listen. Default is 0.0.0.0, which
# means "all IP addresses on this host". Note that listening on 0.0.0.0 assumes
# that your mariner instance is running on a trusted network.
host = "0.0.0.0"
# TCP port on which to listen
port = 5000

[cache]
# Directory in which cached information such as file metadata and thumbnails
# will be stored
directory = "/tmp/mariner/"
